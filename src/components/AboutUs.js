                            <b>InstaWash was founded on September 21, 2021 by passionate students of University of Texas at Arlington 
                                working on a course project, which later developed into a business idea. At InstaWash, 
                                we believe there is a better way to provide laundry services, than the conventional methods followed 
                                world-wide. It is our goal to provide quicker and efficient services to customers while also easing the 
                                of payment and delivery through our online services.
                                <br/>
                                We have our stores at all major states of United States and ensure the same quality services in each of the 
                                stores. We at InstaWash are a small team of like minded professionals who aim to provide hassle-free, budget 
                                friendly services to aid the customers.
